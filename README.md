## Todos

### Wheel Screen TODOS

Then wheel in the center would only show around the top of the whell kinda like a paint brush stroke across the middle of the page like read dead redemption style and it will rotate and the color and text  on the wheel will be based on the category and then it will pop up with the actual mission that needs to be completed infront of the wheel as a like overlay

1. wheel colors will be based off of categores eg
    + green farm
    + red pvp
    + purple roleplayer

2. left side will loke like the rust main menu
    + spin wheel
    + missions
    + settings (filters and options)
    + credits?

### Mission Screen TODOS

#### Learn More Button

links to wiki about event / thing (helps people learn more about stuff in game)
#### Complete Green Button / Skip Button

in future probably change this to accept so can hold multiple missions at once incase one literally just cannot be completed right now
also change the skip button to a cancel button **maybe**

#### Future

add % of people that pass in future and if say like 70% of people pass difficulty would be labeled as “hard”

### Option Screen TODOS
options / filters  
+ disable sound
+ disable animation
  
filters:  
+ category adjustments (disable categories like raid or roleplayer stuff)
+ change weigths (sliders maybe like if raid is too rare can make it heavier in weight to show more)
+ disable events that are time based (cargo, heli, airdrops) stuff that can only happen if event is currently going on

## Questions
