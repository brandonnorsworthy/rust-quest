## Introduction

Picks a random event to do in the Sandbox MMO Game **Rust** developed by **Facepunch**, you can click on the wheel or click spin wheel to begin, showing you a nice animation of the style from the bandit camp casino ingame that randomly will pick a category *based off weights for each category* and then will randomly pick a event inside that category for a cool completion based wipe, to challenge yourself for some new events, or just if maybe your group cannot ever thing of what you should do.

## Todos

### Wheel Screen TODOS

Then wheel in the center would only show around the top of the whell kinda like a paint brush stroke across the middle of the page like read dead redemption style and it will rotate and the color and text  on the wheel will be based on the category and then it will pop up with the actual mission that needs to be completed infront of the wheel as a like overlay

1. wheel colors will be based off of categores eg
    + green farm
    + red pvp
    + purple roleplayer

### Mission Screen TODOS

1. Learn More Button

    links to wiki about event / thing (helps people learn more about stuff in game)

2. Complete Green Button / Skip Button

    in future probably change this to accept so can hold multiple missions at once incase one literally just cannot be completed right now
    also change the skip button to a cancel button **maybe**

3. Future

    add % of people that pass in future and if say like 70% of people pass difficulty would be labeled as “hard”

### Option Screen TODOS
1. options
    + disable sound

2. filters:
    + category adjustments (disable categories like raid or roleplayer stuff)
    + change weigths (sliders maybe like if raid is too rare can make it heavier in weight to show more)
    + disable events that are time based (cargo, heli, airdrops) stuff that can only happen if event is currently going on
